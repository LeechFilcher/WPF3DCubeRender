BEFORE YOU START:
==================================================
This Project was a short one-day thing I developed. If you have any questions about the source code, please let me know.
If you want to fix bugs, you can do so, but please note down your fixes inside of the changelog before a commit. If you want to create a better / different kind of rendering, please remember to add a Render Type setting to the MainWindow and User Control.
If you like the project, I would love it if you'd star it or fork it to use it in your projects or just help to improve it.
<br/> Everyone is welcome to contribute!
